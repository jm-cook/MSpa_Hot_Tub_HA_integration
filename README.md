## Obtaining `device_id` and `product_id`

To control your MSPA hot tub, you will need the `device_id` and `product_id` associated with your device. Follow these steps to obtain them from the MSPA Link app:

1. Open the MSPA Link app on your mobile device and log in.
2. Go to the device list and select your hot tub.
3. Tap the device settings or information icon (found in the top left corner).
4. At the bottom of the main screen you will see the `device_id` displayed as a long alphanumeric string. Note this down ready to configure the integration.
5. To obtain the `product_id` you may need to look in the data on your network returned to the app when sending commands.
5. Note down these values for use in the integration configuration.

## Configuration

After installation, you will need to configure the integration in Home Assistant. Before carrying out these steps it is recommended to 
create a guest account on the MSPA Link app to avoid using your main account credentials.
